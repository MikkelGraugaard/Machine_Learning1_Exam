## Description
This is my exam from Machine Learning 1 at my first semester of my masters. The exam was a 4-hour exam, where we got a data set and a set of questions to answer.
The exam main objective was fraud detection of suspicious firms. The data was a cross-section of 1550 observations containing 12 variables and was collected over a 1 year period. The data contained both Ordinal, continuous and binary data.
